## Abstract
We propose Theatergen, a tuning-free method for consistent multi-turn image generation. The key idea is to utilize LLM for character management with `layout` and `id` and customize each `character` to avoid attention leakage. We further propose the `CMIGBench` for evaluating the consistency in multi-turn image generation.
